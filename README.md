# Tutorials and Guides
This repository contains programming tutorials and associated notes.  

Often when working on a new project or programming topic for work or as a personal challenge I end up taking notes to remind myself in the future of the procedures and steps I followed. Usually these notes are not note worthy, but occasionally they become closer to a tutorial or guide and it's these which I am storing here.  

Because these are often written primarily with the aim of reminding myself of a technique, in the future, the writing can be subpar. Therefore while I am making some of these available in case they are of interest to other people please excuse the variable quality of the guides present.
