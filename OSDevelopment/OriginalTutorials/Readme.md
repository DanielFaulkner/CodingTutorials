# Original guides  

These are the original guides written nearly 20 years ago, preserved here incase during the rewrites and conversion to markdown syntax some of the content has been lost or incase someone prefers the more haphazard writing style used in those guides.  

If using these original guides please do compare them with the updated versions as some errors have been corrected and additional explainations added during the rewriting process.

Additionally any contact details within these guides are outdated and are no longer valid. If you wish to leave a comment please use Git Hubs issue tracker instead.
