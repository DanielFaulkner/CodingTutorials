# Operating System Development tutorials

The guides in this folder are related to the development of hobby Operating Systems.  

A basic level of assembly code knowledge is recommended to understand the examples given in these guides.  

These majority of these guides were first written around the year 2000. The code examples and tools should still work on current computers and much of the information is still relevant. However I have not been involved in the hobby Operating System development scene for some time, so further guides are unlikely to be written. Although I will attempt to maintain the current guides.

Some of the tutorials have been prefixed with a number to indicate the suggested reading order. If you were to follow each tutorial you should have a reasonable understanding of how to create a simple real mode bootloader which can display messages to the monitor and load a file from a FAT filesystem.  

Currently I am in the process of editing these to correct errors, convert to markdown format and improve the grammar and code explainations.

Current status:
- 5Userinput.md is a placeholder and has not been written.
- Debugging.md is a placeholder and has not been written.
- RealModeMemory.md is a placeholder and has not been written.
- IntTut.txt has not yet been updated.
- A20tut.txt has not yet been updated.
- AssemblyPrimer.md contains content which has been cropped from the other guides and needs rewritting.
