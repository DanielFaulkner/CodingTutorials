# Tools and Utilities  

This folder contains any small tools and test programs or scripts which maybe useful when developing a hobby operating system.  

**Disk Addressing Converter:**  
This is a small python implementation of the LBA to CHS conversion, and vice versa. This can be modified to test different arrangements of the formula, or studied to see the formula in use within a higher level language.  
This contains a function for LBA to CHS conversion and a function for CHS to LBA conversion. If run from the command line instead of imported the program will convert the numbers from 1 to 1000 to the CHS addressing system, displaying the result, then back to the LBA addressing system, again printing the result.  

*Still to come:*  
*Memory location converter (segment start/end positions etc)*  
*Assembly program for testing functions*
